This game is a Tetris clone that I made for my studies. I tried to implement a simple
"state based architecture" in a full object oriented program. Remember that this was
developed as a learning project.

This project is based on the SFML library (http://www.sfml-dev.org). The version of SFML
used in this project (2.0) was in development when I made this Tetris. There's a chance
things won't work with a recent release.

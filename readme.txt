This game is a Tetris clone that I made for my studies. I tried to implement a
simple "state based architecture" in a full object oriented program. Remember
that this game was developed as a learning project. The source codes are
commented with Doxygenformatted comments.

This project is based on the SFML library (http://www.sfml-dev.org). The version of
SFML used in this project (2.0) was in development when I made this Tetris. There's
a chance things won't work with a recent release.

Also, I used a font named "Visitor" that I took from here :

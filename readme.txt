This game is a Tetris clone that I made for my studies. I tried to implement a
simple "state based architecture" in a full object oriented program. Remember
that this game was developed as a learning project. The source codes are
commented with Doxygenformatted comments.

This project is based on the SFML 2.1 library (http://www.sfml-dev.org).
SFML on GitHub : https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML

Also, I used a font named "Visitor" that I took from here :

 ^  Note that a file is missing. I removed the resources/audio/tetris_theme.ogg
/!\ file because it was copyrighted.
